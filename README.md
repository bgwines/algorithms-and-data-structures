functional-data-structures
==========================

Data structure implementations in functional languages (predominantly Haskell), following *Purely Functional Data Structures*, by Chris Okasaki.

Dependencies
------------

- [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
- [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org/) (`brew install graphviz`)
- [Haskell GraphViz](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphviz) (`cabal install graphviz`)
- [HLib](https://github.com/bgwines/hlib)

Leftist heaps
------------
A leftist heap is a (binary) heap with the property that the rank of the left child of any node is greater than or equal to the rank of the right child, where the rank of the node is the minimum of the lengths of all its root-null paths.

Pairing heaps
-------------
A pairing heap is a heap-ordered multiway tree. It is defined by its behavior during the `dequeue_min` operation, which restructures the by merging adjacent pairs of children and then folding along that list with the merging operation.

Splay heaps
-----------
A splay heap is a heap-ordered self-balancing BST that re-structures itself through smarter-than-na√Øve tree rotations to allow more frequently accessed elements to be faster to access.

Skew binary random access lists
-------------------------------
A random-access list is a data structure that supports most list operations (e.g. `cons`, `head`, `tail`), but also indexing operations such as `set` and `at`.

This implemented usines a sparse representation of skew binary numbers. It is a numerical representation backed by a list of complete binary trees.

The skew binary number system is a positional number system where the weights are not `2^i`, as in traditional binary, but rather `2^(i+1) - 1`. Digits are allowed to be `0`, `1`, or `2`, with the restriction that only the least significant nonzero digit is allowed to be `2`. With this restriction, every natural number has a unique representation under this system [Mye83]; otherwise, the system is redundant.

We represent the digit `2` at position `i` in our sparse representation as the concatenation of two trees of order `w_i`.

List operations (`cons`, `head`, and `tail`) run in constant time, whereas array operations (`set` and `at`) run in logarithmic time (more specifically, `min(i, log n)`, where `i` is the index in question).
